\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose for this document is to build test plan for project Breaking Effect.Test cases in the document are designed based on SRS of the project and aim to cover both functional and non-functional requirements described in SRS.\\ 

This document is used as a guide that need to be followed exactly in test stage before release of this project. \\

\subsection{Scope}
This test plan covers verification and validation for the project Breaking Effect to make sure the program is implemented as requirement specifiction, including automated testing, system test and unit test. The project relies on Unity3D as platform and uses function provided by Unity3D for object cutting. So test for object cutting is not included in this test plan. This test plan is designed based on SRS so that it doesn't cover test cases for requirements not in SRS. 

\subsection{Overview of Document}

This test plan firstly describes environment and platform for Breaking Effect. Purpose and scope of outlined the document generally in previous sections. Detailed test plan and test cases are covered in following sections including test team, automated testing approach, verification tools and test cases for both functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}

Breaking effect presents how the pieces of an object move after it separates into parts with
suddenness or violence.

This project implements running time breaking effect in codes for 3-D models in unity3D without help from any similar plug-in. Including different shapes 3-D objects breaking based on physics and pieces interacting with the momentum provided by the breaking force. The breaking effect program simulates 3-D objects destruction process in vision by implementing scientific computing functions.

This project concentrates on calculation while
HCI or GUI are not important parts. Applied force is decided in codes in advance as input
and trace of motion is the output after calculation.

\subsection{Test Team}
The team that is responsible for all tests is Xiaoye Ma.
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

Most testing work for Breaking Effect does not rely on automated testing. Because the final output is visualization and experience from users. Verification of inputs will be done automatically through help from Unit Test Generator provided by IDE Visual Studio 2017. Test cases are covered in following sections. Verification of correctness and output from intermediate steps will be tested manually.  

Automated testing also helps check correctness of C$\#$ codes including bugs and syntax errors detecting.
 
\subsection{Verification Tools}

The project is implemented by C$\#$ programming language that is supported by platform Unity3D. The program is written through IDE Visual Studio 2017 which supports following tools:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Unit Test Generator\\
	
	Unit Test Generator will be used to decrease workload involved in creating new unit tests. It helps the routine test creation tasks. It also provides the ability to generate and configure test project and test class. 
	
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Automatic code checking\\
	
	Visual Studio automatically help check code error when developer is programming to pick out errors including syntax error, grammar error. 	
\end{itemize}
% \subsection{Testing Schedule}
		
% See Gantt Chart at the following url ...

\subsection{Non-Testing Based Verification}
Code walkthrough will be done by developer and a peer reviewer to identify any defects. They both review codes and do logic analysis to see if the program satisfies all requirements in SRS. The walkthrough should also find and fix possible bugs and peer reviewer is expected to provide any comment to help developer improve the program.
\section{System Test Description}

Section \ref{Sec_TestInput} focuses on verifying correctness of users inputs that covers \rref{R_Inputs} and \rref{R_VerifyOutput}. Testing cases in this section ensure Breaking Effect can handle both valid inputs and invalid inputs. Corresponding error messages for different situations of invalid inputs including incomplete inputs, inputs in incorrect data types and inputs do not satisfy data constraints.\\  
Sections from \ref{Sec_testGravityCenter} focus on verifying outputs from intermediate steps and make sure all modules in program work correctly that cover other functional requirements including \rref{R_InitialSpeed}, \rref{R_Piece}, \rref{R_Calculate}, \rref{R_Output1}, \rref{R_Output2}.
